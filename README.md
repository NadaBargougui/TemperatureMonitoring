# 🌡️ Temperature Monitoring System

📌 Overview

The Temperature Monitoring System is an advanced IoT-based solution designed to measure and track temperature in real-time. It utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller with a DHT22 temperature sensor to collect data, while a Raspberry Pi hosts the Mosquitto MQTT broker for efficient communication. A modern web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and React.js provides a user-friendly interface for data visualization and real-time email alerts when temperature thresholds are exceeded.

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time Monitoring: Continuously measures and displays temperature values 📊
✅ Data Logging: Stores temperature readings for historical analysis 📂
✅ Web Dashboard: Interactive UI for monitoring temperature trends 💻
✅ Alert System: Sends email notifications when temperature crosses predefined limits 🔔
✅ MQTT Communication: Uses ESP32 to publish data to a Raspberry Pi-hosted Mosquitto broker 🔄

🛠️ Technologies Used

Hardware

⚡ ESP32 (Microcontroller)

🌡️ DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)

🍓 Raspberry Pi (Hosting MQTT Broker with Mosquitto)

Software

🟢 Node.js & Express.js (Backend API)

🔷 React.js (Frontend UI)

📈 Chart.js (Data Visualization)

🎨 Reactstrap (UI Components)


🏗️ Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Install Node.js and npm 🟢

Set up Mosquitto MQTT broker on Raspberry Pi 


Steps to Run the Project

# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
'git clone https://github.com/NadaBargougui/TemperatureMonitoring.git'

'cd TemperatureMonitoring'

# 2️⃣ Backend Setup
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ node server.js

# 3️⃣ Frontend Setup
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start

💡 Ensure your Raspberry Pi is running the Mosquitto broker, and the ESP32 is publishing temperature data.
